- 👋 Hi, I’m @kefkolo
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all things related to the Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics. I am not a developer. I am a technical writer who needs an executive-level understanding (and beyond) of what the teams I support are doing and what they are talking about to explain it to non-technical (and technical) users.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm not sure yet. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can email me at kefkolotest@gmail.com
